# Welcome to the IdeaBox!

## An interactive space where you can jot down your own ideas!

**Here's a little "how-to" to get you started!**

* Got an idea? Type in a **Title** that defines it, and then head to the **Body** to "flesh out" the details!

* Is your idea solid? Then hit that **Save** button to drop your idea down below, and then start another...and another...and...another???

* If there's an idea you REALLY like, click on the **star** icon to favorite it, or you can unfavorite it the same way!

* Maybe you only want to see your favorites? Great! Click on the **"Show Starred Ideas"** button and all of your best ideas will be displayed!

* "Well, what if I want to go back see *ALL* my ideas again?", you ask. Just click on the **"Show All Ideas"** button and BAM, you're back!

* Say you have too many ideas on the page and want to search through them. No problem! Just start typing in the *Search ideas* box and your ideas will filter down as you type! WOW!

* If you're ever not into one of your ideas, just hit the **X** on the top right of the card and "PRESTO!", it's gone!

## We hope that you enjoy your experience on our site! Thank you for visiting!
